# Documenting

## Why
Having good docs provided to you by others makes your life better and easier. If you find yourself working on some kind of (software) project, chances are that you will be the one working on something new. This means that you will be the one who will have to provide at least some basic documentation on:
- what the project you are working on does
- how the project you are working on is used (if applicable)

You might also (choose to) be responsible for writing documentation on other peoples' work.

## Markdown
In both cases, when working on an open source project (be it your own, your companies or in any other form) you will most likely have to write documentation in a formatting language called Markdown. The next module focuses on how to write documentation in Markdown.

Being able to produce at least basic documentation is considered a base skill.
Being able to produce at least basic markdown files is considered a base skill.

## Structure

Documentation structure varies from service to service.

### GitHub
GitHub uses a system that works with `README.md` files. As long as a repository (basically, a 'project') holds a `README.md` file, GitHub will automatically display the contents of this file as rendered html on the projects 'homepage'.

### GitHub Pages/Jekyll
You will also find documentation on pages that are a bit more than just regular markdown files. Using a platform like Jekyll (used in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) it is possible to build entire websites/blogs, once again, using Markdown.

### Readthedocs
Another service you are likely to run into is [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.io). They offer a service to host documentation that consists of several seperate documents. It's free and guess what? You can use Markdown again.

## General tips
First of all: save yourself as much work as possible: use templates, conventions and other available recourses to make sure you don't have to think to much about secondary stuff; you want to focus on working on your project, not on the structure of your README file.

If you find documentation you like and love to use, consider adopting it's style and structure. Maybe they used some guidelines you can find online?

Don't overdo it; make sure the size and the format of your documentation fit your project; hosting a readthedocs.io project for a single line of explanation is a tad much and a better fit would have been a GitHub `README.md`.
