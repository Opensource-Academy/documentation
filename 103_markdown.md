# Markdown
## Description
> “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. -[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
This module focuses on the formatting side of Markdown. Markdown formatting is widely supported by and used in a wide variety of fields and tools including GitHub project documentation.

Markdown is best learned by simply writing a markdown file (like a README.md) or editing an existing markdown file.

Since you are most likely going to use GitHub (or a similar service) for you first markdown file, get started by reading these documents:

- https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/

- https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

## Custom Markdown
Services sometimes add extras to default Markdown. An example would be GitHub, which uses 'GitHub Flavored Markdown' or [GFM](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown).

Keep an eye out for useful extras, but be sure to use them wisely if you want to use the same markdown file on different services.

## Practise
Markdown is easily practised by adding a simple README.md to every (programming) project you work on, explaining what the project does, is about, and/or how the project is used.

To quickly get used to conventions and learn how to structure your README and other markdown documents, have a look at other projects' README files. You can learn a lot by simply having a look at a README like [this one](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/README.md).

Once you have worked with a lot of documentation, you will develop your own taste of what you like or not like in documentation. This also applies to how you prefer your documentation to be structured.
