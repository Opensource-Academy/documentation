# Documentation

## Read the docs...

### to get started
Good documentation also offers a perfect starting point for getting started with something new. In the case of programming languages or software project, the docs might even include one or several examples on how the language or software works.


### before you ask
Read them. Especially before you start asking questions.
Not having read the documentation or having done some research on your own before asking questions is pretty much considered a [sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin) on most online message boards and simlilar places.

## Reading the docs
Documentation can come in one or several forms. Frequently seen formats are:
- on a projects homepage
- GitHub `README.md` file
- readthedocs.io entry
- a wiki (on github, on a projects homepage)

Keep the following in mind while reading documentation:

- Not all documentation is equal
- Some documantion is bad
- Some documantion is good
- Some documentation is bad for you
- Some documentation is good for you
- Some documentation is bad for you now
- Some documentation is good for you now
- Some documentation will be better for you later

Do not assume that you are not smart enough/not good enough/a tool is bad because of it's documentation; if docs are not suitable for you, for whatever reason, look for other docs. If you are lucky, (and this is very likely) someone else also didn't like the docs you tried to use and wrote something else.

You might find guides, tips and tricks and even full manuals on blogs, GitHub and other websites.

## Finding the docs
Not all projects come with documentation (because the docs are not done, the project just started, the author didn't feel like writing docs, etc), however, a lot of projects do come with some form of documentation.

An easy way to get to the docs is by using a search engine, simply using google to look up a project by it's name will often return the homepage, github page and/or readthedocs.io pages (considering any of these exist). If you do not get any of these from your search, consider adding "github", "docs", "readme" or "wiki" to your search query.
